       <p>Eve here! I have a background in art and clinical social work.  I am passionate about combining creativity and helping others with technology!  I am from Santa Fe, New Mexico but have lived in many parts of the Southwest and recently moved to Seattle to go attend Code Fellows!  I have two awesome dogs and love to be outside, even in the rain.</p>

       <p>Hi! My name is Ronel Rustia. I was born in the Philippines and began my residence here in the U.S. when I was 14 years old. I'm a veteran of the military (former Airforce member). My hobbies include playing online games like chess, building small model car replicas, and hiking new trails when I have time. I also like learning new things, especially programming and learning new concepts.  What I find interesting are mostly things about Astronomy, new physics discoveries, and advancement in Artificial Intelligence.</p>

       <p>Hey! And my name is Elyanil Castro! But you can just call me Castro. I took a semester off from Amherst College so that I could come to Seattle and enroll in Code Fellows. While at Code Fellows, my goal is to gain a deeper understanding of computer programming and to learn how to become a better developer. My hobbies include exercising and listening to podcasts. Also, I like to call people, tell them that I can't talk right now, and then hang up.</p>
