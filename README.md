# Project "Music-Guru"

## Synopsis

Mentally, this project is to test our ability to work as a group. And also to show ourselves how far we've come in comparison to where we were in the beginning of the class. Technically, this is to test our skill by developing a problem and creating a solution that is achievable within the given time-frame.
For this particular project, the problem domain will be as follows,

*User Stories:
1. As a developer, I would want to create an entertaining trivia game that is simple but engaging, that will<br> include 6 music genres.
2. As a developer, the code would be DRY and simple to understand.<br>
3. As a developer, percentages and ‘em’ measurements will be used for dynamic styling.<br>
4. As a developer,  local storage will be used for data persistence.<br>
5. As a developer, the main pages will include an index page, an ‘About us’ page, and the genre pages.*<br>

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

We decided to chose this project among many because it seems appropriate to the time-frame allotted for us to complete our MVP. It's purpose is to serve as a final project to demonstrate what we learned in the course, and to give us a chance to be creative with our new found knowledge. And most importantly, because we loved listening to music.
